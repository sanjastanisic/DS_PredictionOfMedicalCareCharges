# Prediction of Medical Care Charges using ML models
This project focuses on predicting individual health care expenses using supervised machine learning models, aiming to support insurance companies in determining appropriate premium rates. The analysis is based on the publicly available Medical Cost Personal Dataset, which includes data from 1.338 individuals with features such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and medical charges. Various regression models were implemented and evaluated, including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Regression Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (with linear and radial kernels), and a Bayesian Regularized Neural Network. The models were developed using KNIME Analytics Platform and R, and their performance was assessed using 5-fold cross-validation. Among the tested models, the Support Vector Machine with Radial Kernel produced the most accurate predictions, followed closely by Random Forest and the Bayesian Neural Network, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of machine learning in predicting health care costs based on measurable personal attributes. Here is the [final report](SanjaStanisic_ML_FinalProjectt.pdf).
